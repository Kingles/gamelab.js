GameLab	- by Seandon Mooy
	A game engine, based on NodeJS and ThreeJS, written in Coffee-Script
	The spirital successor to the "E" engines.

To great a new project

    ./gamelab.js/server/gamelab.sh myAwesomeProject

Starting the server!

    cd myAwesomeProject/server/

    ./init.js

Take a look in client/core.coffee in your new project
as well as the scene it changes to, client/scenes/example.coffee.

Remember, init.js will stay open, running the web server, socket server, and compiling your coffeescript.
Keep an eye on it for coffeescript compile errors, or server runtime errors!

Gamelab is not meant to be monolithic - in fact it's a small set of scripts hobbled together to
create a boilerplate for creating all sorts of javascript applications.

Please feel free to hack at gamelab.js/client/core, shared/core, etc!

Good luck!
